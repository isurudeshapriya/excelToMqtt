# excelToMqtt



Implementing an End-to-End IoT System with JSON and MQTT

This project showcases my hands-on experience in developing a comprehensive IoT solution. Leveraging the power of Python, it extracts data seamlessly from Microsoft Excel files and transmits each row's information over MQTT in JSON format. This streamlined data flow creates a bridge between Excel-based data sources and MQTT-enabled IoT ecosystems. Whether you're looking to integrate your business data into IoT platforms or explore innovative ways to utilize Excel data, this project offers a flexible and efficient solution. The project's flexibility allows you to configure MQTT broker settings, making it adaptable to a wide range of IoT environments. Explore the code, contribute, and unlock new possibilities for connecting and automating data pipelines in your IoT projects.
